I am in the MSc in Data Science program at [Harvard SEAS](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/programs/graduate/applied-computation/master-of-science-in-data-science"). I am interested in using data science to improve public health, public interest technology, and the governance of AI.

Before coming to Harvard, I was BlueDot’s first data scientist where I used natural language processing to monitor infectious disease activity. I have a BSc in Mathematics from Dalhousie University where I researched probabilistic networks with [Dr. Jeannette Janssen](https://www.mscs.dal.ca/~janssen/).

You can reach me at joshua_feldman [at] g [dot] harvard [dot] edu.

# Updates

I started a summer fellowship at Harvard where students in the data science programs receive funding to work at nonprofits and public sector organizations over the summer. If you have any thoughts on this, please let me know! If you’re interested in public interest tech, [Bruce Schneier](https://www.schneier.com/) has put together a great [collection](https://public-interest-tech.com/) of resources.

# Research

**Past Projects:**

**Q:** Can we use the news to monitor infectious diseases?<br />
**A:** <a href="https://insights.bluedot.global/Account/Login">Yes</a> (with <a href="https://bluedot.global/">BlueDot</a>)

**Q:** Can the prevalence of reinfection tell us about how far we are from controlling an epidemic?<br />
**A:** It [can](https://jammi.utpjournals.press/doi/pdf/10.3138/jammi.2.suppl-1.1) (with [Dr. Sharmistha Mishra](http://stmichaelshospitalresearch.ca/researchers/sharmistha-mishra/) at the [Centre for Urban Health Solutions](http://stmichaelshospitalresearch.ca/research-programs/urban-health-solutions/).

**Q:** How does the behaviour of highly connected individuals affect how diseases spread with respect to communities?<br />
**A:** When popular individuals are more contagious, diseases are more likely to <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-67810-8_5">jump from one community to another</a> (with <a href="https://www.mscs.dal.ca/~janssen/">Dr. Jeannette Janssen</a> at Dalhousie University)

**Q:** Can we use electronic medical records to improve cancer screening rates?<br />
**A:** We <a href="https://bmjopenquality.bmj.com/content/6/1/u213991.w5531">can</a> (with Sam Davie and <a href="https://www.dfcm.utoronto.ca/content/tara-kiran">Dr. Tara Kiran</a> at St. Michael’s Hospital Family Health Team)
