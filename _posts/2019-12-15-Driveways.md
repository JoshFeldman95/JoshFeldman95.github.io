If everything continues as planned, Somerville, Massachusetts — a city just outside of Boston — will be getting a new subway line in 2021. If residents drive to these new stations and park their cars on nearby streets, will people who live on these streets lose access to a parking spot or will they be able to park in their driveway?


Their question is deceptively simple: how many residential units in Somerville have off-street parking?
For my capstone project for Harvard University’s Data Science master’s program, I worked with Lipika Ramaswamy and Anthony Rentsch to partner with the City of Somerville to [answer this question](https://towardsdatascience.com/machine-learning-for-urban-planning-estimating-parking-capacity-15aabd490cf8).

Here's a map of the probability each house has a driveway aggregated to the block-level.
