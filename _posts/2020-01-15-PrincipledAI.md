I was only tangentially related to this project doing some NLP work that didn't really go anywhere, but I think it's very cool, so I wanted to post about it. There has been a recent trend for organizations, both private and public, to post "AI Principles". These documents are intended to guide the development of AI, but they also could just be [ethics-washing](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/614992/ai-ethics-washing-time-to-act/).

In this paper, the team reviewed 36 different AI principles and found "growing consensus around eight key thematic trends: privacy, accountability, safety and security, transparency and explainability, fairness and non-discrimination, human control of technology, professional responsibility, and promotion of human values".
