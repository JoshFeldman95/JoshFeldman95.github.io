The share of Americans who rent their home is [at a 50-year high](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/07/19/more-u-s-households-are-renting-than-at-any-point-in-50-years/), and all US metropolitan areas are facing a [severe shortage of affordable rental units](https://reports.nlihc.org/gap). Though the data show this crisis exists, their ability to guide us to solutions is limited because **we donâ€™t have timely, reliable data on current rents at the neighbourhood level**.

During my summer internship at the Urban Institute, I tried to document this problem and think of strategies to get better information on the rental market.

[Graham MacDonald](https://twitter.com/GrahamIMac) and I wrote a [blog post](https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/rents-are-too-high-here-are-three-ways-get-data-we-need-fix) on the problem and created an interactive data visualization so you can see the differences in estimates for how much it costs to rent a home in your neighbourhood.

Graham also wrote a great [thread](https://twitter.com/GrahamIMac/status/1164519093292212224?s=20) on our work.
